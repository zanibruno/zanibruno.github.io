I am now 2 full months in my Software Development Program. 

At the beginning everything seemed very unfamiliar, and very difficult. But I kept trying, learning, reading, practicing and eventually, things clicked in my head and it all made sense... 

It does get easier, but the more you practice the faster you're going to learn how to build a solid and precisa code. 
Keep practicing, is not because you finishe the lessons early that you can take a few days off... At the beginning it is very important to keep learning, as your brain is new to all of this stuff and can be asily forgotten over a weekend. 

Read, Learn, Practice, Practice and Repeat. Coding was the best way to learn, I can read 20 pages and still not understand perfectly, but after 15 minutes of actually trying to code it myself, I now know why and how it happens.
