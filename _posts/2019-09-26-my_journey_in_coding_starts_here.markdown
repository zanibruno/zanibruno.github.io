**Coding came into my life in a very unexpected way.** 

My fianc√© came to back from work one day and told me that one of the candidates she was interviewing for a job at her company, mentioned FlatIron School during the interview process. At the moment i was unemployed, looking after our 2yo daughter full time. 

So when she mentioned this to me, it quickly got my attention and i went into FlatIron's website straight away, and for the next days i caught myself doing Prework - Software engineering, and I was really enjoying! So I bit the bullet and applied for the Online Full Time Software Engineering Program! It was the best thing i did! The team is amazing, and I making very good friends that i will be able to connect and network for the rest of my life!
