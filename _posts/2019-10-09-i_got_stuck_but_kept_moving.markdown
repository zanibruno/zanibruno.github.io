The real problem of learning to code is the moment where you don't know what to do, or how to solve the issue in your code. 

In many times, we are over complicating things in our head, making things harder that it actually is. I realized that in many cases after speaking with someone else, the problem is actually very simple, and if I do not over complicate things, I can do just fine.

When i get stuck, I try using the Rubber Duck method, or actually speaking with someone else. This is really helpful because when you are explaining the question to someone, you actually come up with your answer. 

Do little steps at a time, making sure that with every change, things keep working, and from there you can improve your program little by little. 

Plan ahead, make sure you know what you want your program to do, write it all out, and then work towards that goal.
