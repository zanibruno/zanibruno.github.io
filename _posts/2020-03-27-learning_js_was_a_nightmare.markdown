This has been the most difficult part of the program so far for me!

My brain, used to Ruby now, just could not understand what was going on with JavaScript and could not remember syntaxes, and structure of a good JS code... 

It took me good 3 weeks to build my project, a lot of research and help from the amazing teachers available on the cohort. 

in the end, what I really take from times like these, is that... No matter how much you read, how many videos you watch, how many people you ask, you're are only going to understand when you code it yourself. Like many people say, Practice, Practice, Practice... 

When I was younger I was an athlete, racing motocross on different places of the country, with best results being 5th on Nationals, this is pretty good I think... But it was only with a lot of practice and a lot of dedication that I was able to achieve this. And it is the same with coding, the more you do, the better you get, and if you dont do it for a while (2 days in my case haha) you forget how to do it.

I am still learning JS and I feel like I have a lot more to learn from this amazing language that does some awesome magics happen!

i still prefer to work with Ruby, maybe because I feel more comfortable, but I cannot wait to dive deeper into JS frameworks and see what else it can do!
